# Jenkins + Nexus Architecture & Risk Analysis

## Current Setup (Assumed)

- Jenkins is deployed in a **private subnet**
- No direct internet access
- Outbound traffic via **NAT Gateway → Internet Gateway**
- Jenkins is **not publicly exposed** (good security practice)
- **No Nexus / Artifactory** is used

During every build, Jenkins downloads dependencies **directly from the internet**.

---

## 🚨 External Dependency Availability (BIGGEST RISK)

### What Happens Today
Every Jenkins build is **100% dependent on external services**.

Flow:
- Build starts
- Jenkins reaches out to **multiple third-party registries**
- Dependencies are downloaded **again and again**

If **any one service** is:
- Slow  
- Rate-limited  
- Temporarily down  

➡️ **Build fails**

---

## CI/CD Availability = Public Internet Dependency

Jenkins does **not decide build success**.

Build success depends on:
- Multiple external systems
- Uncontrolled networks
- Third-party owned & rate-limited services

This creates a **hidden but critical coupling** between internal CI/CD and the public internet.

---

## Even When Everything Internally Is Perfect…

Assume:
- Application code is correct
- Jenkins service is healthy
- EC2 / K8s node is up
- CPU, memory, disk are normal
- NAT & routing are correct

❗ **Build can still fail**

**Why?**  
Dependency resolution happens **outside your control boundary**.

---

## NAT Gateway ≠ Reliability Guarantee

Common assumption:
> “We have NAT, so internet access is reliable.”

Reality:
- NAT is **only a network path**
- It does NOT guarantee:
  - Service availability
  - Bandwidth fairness
  - API rate acceptance
  - CDN responsiveness

Additional problems:
- NAT IPs are **shared**
- External services may **throttle your NAT IP**
- Parallel builds amplify throttling

---

## 🔐 Supply Chain Security Risk (Critical)

### What Jenkins Does Today
- Blindly trusts public registries
- Pulls whatever version is requested

### Threats
- Compromised npm package
- Malicious Docker image
- Yanked dependency replaced upstream

📌 **NAT cannot inspect payloads**

### Impact
- Security breach
- Regulatory failure
- Production compromise

---

## ❌ No Central Artifact Storage

### Without Nexus
- Artifacts exist only in Jenkins agent workspace
- After job completion or agent cleanup:
  - Workspace deleted
  - Artifact permanently lost

❗ No centralized, persistent **system of record** for build outputs.

---

# ✅ Key Advantages of Using Nexus

## 1️⃣ Faster Builds

Projects depend on:
- Java → Maven / Gradle (`.jar`)
- Node.js → npm modules
- Docker → base images

### Problem Without Caching
- Hundreds or thousands of dependencies
- Repeated downloads
- Slow & unreliable builds

### With Nexus
- First download cached locally
- Subsequent builds pull from Nexus
- Much faster than internet

---

## 2️⃣ No Repeated Downloads

Without Nexus:
- Each build / agent downloads dependencies individually
- Wasted bandwidth
- External repo overload

With Nexus:
- Central dependency cache
- Download once, reuse everywhere
- Efficient & scalable

---

## 3️⃣ Build Time Reduction (30–70%)

### Impact
- Faster builds

## Current Infrastructure Challenges

### Current Setup Overview

Our Jenkins deployment is configured as follows:

- **Location**: Private subnet without direct internet access
- **Network Path**: Outbound traffic → NAT Gateway → Internet Gateway
- **Security**: Jenkins is not publicly exposed (good practice)
- **Artifact Management**: No Nexus/Artifactory - direct internet downloads

### External Dependency Risks

#### The Problem

Every Jenkins build is **100% dependent on external services**. During each build:

1. Jenkins reaches out to multiple third-party registries over the internet
2. Dependencies are downloaded repeatedly
3. Any slow, rate-limited, or unavailable service causes build failures

#### Why This Matters

Even when everything internal is perfect:

- ✅ Application code has no issues
- ✅ Jenkins service is healthy
- ✅ EC2/Kubernetes infrastructure is up
- ✅ Resources (CPU, memory, disk) are normal
- ✅ NAT Gateway and routing are functional

**Builds can still fail** because dependency resolution happens outside our control.

#### NAT Gateway Limitations

Common misconception: *"We have NAT, so internet access is reliable"*

Reality:

- NAT provides only a **network path**
- Does NOT guarantee:
  - Service availability
  - Bandwidth fairness
  - API rate acceptance
  - CDN responsiveness
- NAT IPs can be throttled by external services
- Multiple concurrent builds amplify throttling issues

### Security Vulnerabilities

#### Current Security Risks

| Risk | Description | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Supply Chain Attacks** | Blindly trusts public registries | Compromised packages reach production |
| **No Payload Inspection** | NAT cannot inspect content | Malicious code goes undetected |
| **Version Control** | No control over dependency versions | Unstable/vulnerable versions can be pulled |
| **No Auditing** | Cannot track what was downloaded | Compliance failures |

#### Common Threats

- Compromised npm packages
- Malicious Docker images
- Upstream dependency replacements
- Hijacked library versions

### Performance Issues

#### No Central Artifact Storage

**Current Behavior:**
- Build artifacts stored temporarily on Jenkins agents
- Artifacts lost when workspace is cleaned or agent recreated
- No centralized, persistent system of record

**Consequences:**
- Cannot rollback to previous versions easily
- Must rebuild from source for rollbacks (risky)
- No artifact traceability
- Inconsistent deployments

---

## Why Nexus Repository Manager?

### Key Benefits

#### 1. Faster Builds (30-70% improvement)

**How It Works:**

Every software project relies on dependencies:
- Java → Maven/Gradle (.jar files)
- Node.js → npm modules
- Docker → base images
- Python → pip packages

**Without Nexus:**
- Dependencies downloaded from internet every build
- Large projects have hundreds/thousands of dependencies
- Each download takes time (several minutes)
- Slow and unreliable builds

**With Nexus:**
- Local copy stored on first download
- Subsequent builds pull directly from Nexus
- Much faster than internet downloads

**Example Time Savings:**

| Build Time | Without Nexus | 30% Reduction | 70% Reduction |
|------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Original | 20 minutes | 14 minutes | 6 minutes |
| Daily Builds (10x) | 200 minutes | 140 minutes | 60 minutes |
| **Weekly Savings** | - | **6 hours** | **14 hours** |

#### 2. Reduced Internet Dependency

**Problem Without Nexus:**
- Every build fetches from internet via NAT
- Build failures if NAT is down
- Slower builds due to network latency
- Risk from external registry unavailability

**Solution With Nexus:**
- Acts as local cache and proxy
- First fetch from internet, then cached locally
- Subsequent builds work without internet access

## Nexus Architecture

### Repository Types

Nexus provides three types of repositories to manage artifacts effectively:

#### A) Hosted Repository

**Purpose:** Store internal company artifacts

**Use Cases:**
- Internal Docker images
- Internal npm packages
- Internal Helm charts
- Private libraries and tools

**Benefits:**
- Full control over internal artifacts
- Version management
- Access control
- Audit trails

#### B) Proxy Repository

**Purpose:** Cache external dependencies locally

**How It Works:**

1. Connects to public internet registry (Docker Hub, npmjs, Ubuntu apt, etc.)
2. Downloads package **only once**
3. Caches inside Nexus
4. Subsequent requests served from cache (no internet required)

**Examples:**
- `docker-proxy` → pulls from Docker Hub
- `npm-proxy` → pulls from registry.npmjs.org
- `apt-proxy` → pulls from archive.ubuntu.com

**Key Benefits:**
- Solves security issues
- Dramatically improves speed
- Reduces internet dependency
- Provides offline capability

#### C) Group Repository

**Purpose:** Combine hosted and proxy repositories into single endpoint

**Benefits:**
- Developers configure **ONE URL** only
- Transparent routing to hosted/proxy repos
- Simplified configuration management

**Example:**
- `npm-group` = `npm-hosted` + `npm-proxy`
- `docker-group` = `docker-hosted` + `docker-proxy`

### How Proxy Repository Works

**Example:** Developer runs `npm install express`

**Request Flow:**
```
Developer → Nexus → npm-group → [npm-hosted + npm-proxy]
```

**Process:**

1. **Check Cache:** npm-proxy checks if `express` is cached locally
2. **Cache Hit:** If cached → return immediately (fast)
3. **Cache Miss:** If not cached → fetch from `https://registry.npmjs.org/`
4. **Store:** Nexus caches the package
5. **Return:** Package delivered to developer

**Subsequent Requests:** Served directly from cache (no internet)

### Technology Support

Nexus supports all major package formats and registries:

| Technology | Proxy Target | Hosted Repo | Group Repo |
|------------|--------------|-------------|------------|
| **npm/yarn/pnpm** | `registry.npmjs.org` | `npm-hosted` | `npm-group` |
| **Docker** | `registry-1.docker.io` | `docker-hosted` | `docker-group` |
| **Ubuntu apt** | `archive.ubuntu.com` | `apt-hosted` | `apt-group` |
| **Helm** | `charts.helm.sh` | `helm-hosted` | `helm-group` |
| **Python (pip)** | `pypi.org` | `pypi-hosted` | `pypi-group` |
| **Maven/Java** | `repo.maven.apache.org` | `maven-hosted` | `maven-group` |

### Jenkins Integration

**Jenkins pulls everything from Nexus:**
- npm installs
- Maven builds
- Docker image builds
- apt package installs
- Helm chart downloads

**Result:** Everything is secure, cached, and controlled

---

## High Availability Setup

### OSS vs PRO Comparison

#### Important Reality Check

> ⚠️ **Nexus OSS (free version) does NOT support true clustered HA**
> 
> Only **Nexus PRO** supports official HA (multiple active nodes + shared blob storage + shared database)

#### What You GET with OSS on Kubernetes

| Feature | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Automatic pod restart** | ✅ | Kubernetes restarts crashed pods → Basic resilience |
| **Persistent storage** | ✅ | PVC keeps data safe → No data loss on pod recreation |
| **Easy upgrades** | ✅ | Helm-based rolling upgrades → Controlled downtime |
| **Scalable storage** | ✅ | S3, PVC, NFS support → Better reliability |
| **Small/medium teams** | ✅ | Free version sufficient for most use cases |

#### What You DON'T GET with OSS on Kubernetes

| Limitation | Status | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| **Multi-pod load balancing** | ❌ | `replicaCount` must be 1 |
| **Active-active clustering** | ❌ | Only Nexus PRO supports this |
| **True High Availability** | ❌ | Pod restart ≠ HA cluster |
| **Horizontal scaling** | ❌ | Cannot run multiple replicas |

### HA Components

For **Nexus PRO High Availability**, you need:

#### 1. Multiple Nexus PRO Application Pods (2-3 nodes)

- All nodes active-active
- Behind single Kubernetes Ingress or LoadBalancer
- Load distributed across pods

#### 2. External PostgreSQL Database

**Why Required:**

Nexus PRO HA requires shared metadata storage across all nodes for:
- Repository configuration
- Component and asset information
- Permissions and roles
- User accounts
- Task states
- Job management
- Internal indexes
- **Distributed lock management** (prevents corruption)

**Recommended:**
- AWS RDS PostgreSQL
- Managed service for reliability
- Automated backups
- Multi-AZ deployment

**Important:** Database stores metadata only, NOT artifacts

#### 3. Shared Blob Store

All Nexus pods must access **one shared storage** for artifacts.

**Recommended:**
- **AWS S3** (best for AWS deployments)
- MinIO (on-premises alternative)
- NFS (not recommended for production)

**Data Separation:**
- ✅ **Artifacts** → Stored in Blob Store (S3/MinIO)
- ✅ **Metadata** → Stored in Database (PostgreSQL)

#### 4. Ingress / Load Balancer

Distributes traffic between Nexus pods for high availability.

## Best Practices

### Repository Organization

1. **Use Group Repositories** for developer/CI access
2. **Separate Hosted repos** for different teams/projects
3. **Configure Proxy repos** for each external registry
4. **Regular cleanup** of old artifacts

### Security Recommendations

1. **Disable anonymous access** in production
2. **Enable LDAP/SSO** integration
3. **Use Docker Bearer Token Realm** for Docker authentication
4. **Regular security scans** with integrated tools
5. **Implement RBAC** (Role-Based Access Control)

### Performance Optimization

1. **Use blob stores** efficiently (S3 for cloud)
2. **Configure cleanup policies** to remove old artifacts
3. **Monitor disk usage** and set quotas
4. **Enable aggressive caching** for frequently used dependencies

### Monitoring & Maintenance

1. **Set up health checks** in Kubernetes
2. **Monitor blob store** size and growth
3. **Regular database backups** (for PRO with PostgreSQL)
4. **Track repository usage** metrics
5. **Review audit logs** periodically

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Cannot Pull Docker Images

**Symptoms:**
- `unauthorized: access to the requested resource is not authorized`

**Solution:**
1. Verify Docker Bearer Token Realm is active
2. Check repository permissions
3. Verify `docker login` credentials
4. Ensure correct registry URL

#### Slow Artifact Downloads

**Symptoms:**
- Slow pulls from Nexus compared to internet

**Solution:**
1. Check network connectivity between Jenkins/client and Nexus
2. Verify blob store performance (S3 vs local)
3. Check Nexus resource limits (CPU/Memory)
4. Review concurrent connection limits

#### Repository Not Caching

**Symptoms:**
- Every request goes to upstream registry

**Solution:**
1. Verify proxy repository remote URL
2. Check Maximum component age in proxy settings
3. Review negative cache settings
4. Clear repository cache and retry
